# Programmer Pop
Programmer Pop is a Bejeweled Clone written in Javascript, jQuery, HTML5, and CSS3. It's visual style is meant to emulate a classic version of a Windows Desktop, with Clippy representing your guide through the world of Programmer Pop. This game was created over the course of two days during a Hackathon, and was further polished over the course of months after the Hackathon had ended.

### Features
- Match icons for various coding languages in groups of 3 to 5, and try to build your score as high as possible.
- Drag your game window wherever you'd like on your virtual desktop. You can even close it, if you're daring!
- Your high score will be remembered for you, so you can try to beat your high score any time you come back to play. 
- Tiles can be matched with any icon on the game board, so don't feel restricted by the traditional playstyle of only matching adjacent tiles.
  - Use forethought and careful planning to build up large combos! 
- If you get tired of Clippy's helpful message box, give him a click, and he'll sit helpfully in the corner of your dekstop without talking. In true Clippy fashion, you can make him stop talking, but he'll never go away!
